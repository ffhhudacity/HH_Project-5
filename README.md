Note:

I realized that in order to fulfill the search filter requirement, I'll have to start with a pre-determined list of places. So after spending tons of time trying to revise my old code, I had to restart a new one, but tried to make it a lot simpler this time.




Instructions on how to use my Neighborhood Map Page. Note: I put "Stanford, CA" as the default search address as it is my neighborhood.

	1. Download the GitHub ZIP to your computer and extract the zip file; then you can open index.html in your chrome browser.

	2. Or alternatively, fork the repository, load the index.html into you chrome browser.



Other notes: 

1). I chose to use Foursquare.com to show their top picks on the map, since Foursquare.com is my favorite website to refer to when visiting a new city.

2). on the left to the map shown is a list of four popular coffee shops in Palo Alto, CA.

3). I got a lot of help from my friends who work as a web developer. 

4). Below are some websites that I searched when working on this project.
